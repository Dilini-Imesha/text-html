<p>Rugby (English for rugby) isa ball sport thatspread throughout the 19th century in England. He shares his origins with football. In the first half of the 19th century, the school in Rugby, according to which the game is named, promoted the type of football in which a player can run with the ball in his hands. In the second half of the 19th century, indigenous rugby became two sports with different rules: rugby union(15-year-old rugby , Czech "rugby", a more widespread variant with 15 players on each side) and rugby league ( thirteenrugby, Czech "thirteen", with 13 players), from which other variants (e.g. rugby 7's or tag rugby) evolved over time.

American , Canadian and Australian football has also evolved from the same foundation.</p>


<p>According to research studies, top-level rugby is one of the sports that are high risk for athletes. Top rugby players, as well as hockey players, handball players, football players or American football players, are more prone to developing osteoarthritis of the knees and hips than people who play little or no sports. [1] However, apart from articles in tabloid diaries[2], there is not much literature that objectively deals with this issue outside the highest level.</p>
