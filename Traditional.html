<p>Some of the traditional sports in Sri Lanka include kabaddi, gillidanda (proto-cricket), kili thadthu, kanna muchi, thenkai addi, elle, එල්ලේ ක්‍රීඩාව bahu, thattu, and gudu. There are two styles of martial arts native to Sri Lanka, which are Cheena di and Angampora.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that the ancient Sinhalese indulged in some form of sport or other. Hunting and horse-racing, favourite pastimes of the ancient Indo-Aryans would have also found favour in Sri Lanka following the great Aryan invasion of the island around the 5th century BC</p>

<p>According to Robert Knox, the great sociologist of 17th-century Sri Lanka, it was a symbolic game that symbolized the sexual power of men. It seems that the men who symbolically unleashed their sexual energy in the presence of the Goddess Pattini worked tirelessly for themselves, thus seeking the happiness, comfort and prosperity they needed in their lives.</p>
